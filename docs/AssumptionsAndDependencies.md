# Assumptions and Dependencies

## Related Software and Hardware

The project primarily relies on the Microsoft SharePoint Online environment within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. It requires a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) version 1.13.1 or compatible, running on a modern SharePoint site collection with appropriate permissions configured. The system integrates with Microsoft Graph API, necessitating proper API access and permissions.

For development purposes, the environment requires Node.js runtime environment along with supporting tools such as Gulp task runner and NPM package manager. Version control is managed through Git, and development is optimally conducted using Visual Studio Code or a similar integrated development environment.

On the client side, the application is designed to run on modern web browsers with ES6+ feature support. This includes the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. The application's responsive design ensures compatibility across various screen sizes and devices.

## Operating Systems

The development environment is primarily optimized for Windows 10/11, though the development tools and frameworks also support macOS and Linux operating systems. For end-users in production, there are no specific operating system requirements as the application runs entirely within SharePoint Online through a web browser. This platform-agnostic approach ensures broad accessibility and ease of use across different operating systems.

## End-user Characteristics

The system is designed for various user roles within the organization. This includes SharePoint users with appropriate permissions, facility managers and administrators who oversee the reservation system, regular employees who make reservations, and approvers who review and process requests. Users are expected to have basic familiarity with the SharePoint Online interface and possess valid Microsoft 365 account credentials. An understanding of the reservation workflow process is beneficial but not mandatory, as the interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.

## Dependencies

The application's core framework is built upon several key Microsoft SharePoint Framework libraries, including sp-core-library, sp-webpart-base, sp-lodash-subset, and sp-office-ui-fabric-core, all aligned with version 1.13.1. The user interface is constructed using React 16.8.5 as the primary framework, enhanced by Material-UI components (version 4.12.3) and Office UI Fabric React (version 6.189.2) for a cohesive SharePoint-integrated experience.

Data management is handled through a combination of PnP libraries (version 2.15.0) for SharePoint and Graph API interactions, while form management utilizes Formik and Yup for robust form handling and validation. Date and time operations are managed through a combination of Moment.js and date-fns libraries, ensuring consistent and reliable datetime handling across the application.

## Possible and Probable Changes in Functionality

The system is designed with future scalability and enhancement in mind. In the short term, potential changes may include deeper integration with additional Microsoft 365 services, enhancement of the notification system, and expansion of reporting capabilities. The mobile responsiveness of the application may also see continued improvements to better serve users on various devices.

Looking at long-term scalability, the system is architected to accommodate future support for multiple languages through i18n implementation, integration with additional enterprise systems, and enhanced security features. Performance optimizations for large-scale deployments are also considered in the architectural design.

Technical upgrade paths have been considered, particularly regarding future updates to the SPFx framework, React, Material-UI, and PnPjs libraries. The modular architecture allows for these updates to be implemented with minimal impact on the overall system functionality.

Feature enhancements under consideration include advanced search and filtering capabilities, real-time availability updates, deeper integration with Microsoft Teams, enhanced calendar view functionality, and more sophisticated automated approval workflows. These potential changes are accounted for in the current architecture, allowing for smooth integration of new features as requirements evolve.
